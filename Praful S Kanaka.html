        <h2>1. Types of Problems in Nature (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
        <p>Many computational problems can be categorized based on how they are solved, particularly using iterative, recursive, or backtracking approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iteration</strong> involves repeating a set of instructions until a condition is met. Common in problems where you know the number of iterations ahead of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursion</strong> occurs when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem. It's useful when the problem can naturally be divided into subproblems.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking</strong> is used for problems involving choices, where you explore all possibilities and "backtrack" when a dead-end is reached (e.g., puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens problem).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Space and time efficiency refer to how efficiently an algorithm uses computer resources (memory and time) to solve a problem.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Efficiency</strong> is measured by how fast an algorithm runs as the input size grows. It is often expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n^2)).</li>
            <li><strong>Space Efficiency</strong> refers to the amount of memory the algorithm uses during its execution. Similarly, it is also expressed in Big O notation (e.g., O(1) for constant space, O(n) for linear space).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>Efficiency is crucial for handling large data sets or real-time systems where excessive resource consumption can lead to poor performance or failure to meet operational requirements.</p>
        <h3>Class of Problems and Orders of Growth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constant Time:</strong> O(1) - Algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size (e.g., accessing an array element).</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Time:</strong> O(n) - Time grows linearly with the size of the input (e.g., linear search).</li>
            <li><strong>Quadratic Time:</strong> O(n^2) - Time grows quadratically (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort).</li>
            <li><strong>Logarithmic Time:</strong> O(log n) - Time grows logarithmically (e.g., binary search).</li>
            <li><strong>Exponential Time:</strong> O(2^n) - Time grows exponentially (e.g., brute force approaches to problems like traveling salesman).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>4. Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h2>
        <p>Tree data structures are excellent for modeling hierarchical data. They optimize search and insertion operations, among others.</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Heap:</strong> A binary tree where the parent node is either greater than or smaller than the children (depending on max-heap or min-heap). It is used for efficient priority queues.</li>
            <li><strong>Trie:</strong> A tree-like data structure used to store strings in a way that allows for fast lookup, insertion, and prefix-based search.</li>

            <li><strong>Tree:</strong> A hierarchical structure with a single root node. Traversals include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-order:</strong> Visit the root, then left subtree, then right subtree.</li>
                    <li><strong>In-order:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-order:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then right subtree, then the root.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> Explore as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> Explore all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Importance of Graph Algorithms: Spanning Trees and Shortest Paths</h2>
        <p>Graph algorithms are fundamental for a wide range of applications, and two key areas where they are particularly useful are in the construction of spanning trees and the computation of shortest paths.</p>
        
        <h3>Spanning Trees</h3>
        <p>A spanning tree of a connected graph is a tree that includes all the vertices of the graph, without any cycles. The importance of spanning tree algorithms lies in their ability to find the minimal connection between all nodes, which is useful in networking, circuit design, and various optimization problems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong> A greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree by adding edges in increasing order of weight, ensuring no cycles are formed.</li>
            <li><strong>Prim's Algorithm:</strong> Another greedy algorithm that grows the minimum spanning tree by starting from an arbitrary node and continuously adding the smallest edge that connects the tree to a new vertex.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These algorithms are crucial for applications such as network design, where you want to minimize the cost of connecting a set of points (e.g., in telecommunications or road networks).</p>

        <h3>Shortest Path Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Shortest path algorithms are used to find the minimum distance between two nodes in a graph. These algorithms are vital for routing, navigation systems, and network flow problems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</strong> A greedy algorithm that computes the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.</li>
            <li><strong>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</strong> A more general algorithm that can handle graphs with negative edge weights and can detect negative weight cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>A* Algorithm:</strong> An extension of Dijkstra’s algorithm that uses heuristics to prioritize paths, making it faster for many real-world applications (e.g., in GPS navigation systems).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These algorithms are crucial for applications like GPS systems (finding the shortest route between two locations), network routing (choosing the shortest path for data transmission), and planning (robot motion planning or air traffic management).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Algorithm Design Techniques</h2>
        <p>Algorithm design techniques provide strategies for solving problems efficiently. The most commonly studied design techniques include:</p>

        <h3>1. Divide and Conquer</h3>
        <p>Divide and conquer is a technique where the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, which are solved independently and then combined to form the final solution. This technique is often applied in problems that exhibit recursive structure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Typically O(n log n) for most divide and conquer algorithms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Greedy Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, with the hope that these choices lead to a globally optimal solution. They are typically simpler to implement than dynamic programming approaches but are not always guaranteed to produce an optimal solution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm for minimum spanning tree, Huffman coding for data compression.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Generally O(E log V) for graph problems (where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Dynamic Programming (DP)</h3>
        <p>Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation. It is used when the problem exhibits the properties of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Often O(n) or O(n^2), depending on the problem's complexity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Backtracking</h3>
        <p>Backtracking is used for problems where a solution needs to be built incrementally, and you abandon partial solutions when you determine that they cannot lead to an optimal solution. It is useful for problems involving choices or permutations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> N-Queens problem, Sudoku solving, and other combinatorial search problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Can be exponential in the worst case (e.g., O(n!)).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Branch and Bound</h3>
        <p>Branch and Bound is a general algorithm for finding optimal solutions to various optimization problems, especially in discrete mathematics. It involves systematically exploring the solution space by branching and pruning parts of the space that cannot lead to a better solution than the best one found so far.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Integer Linear Programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Can vary, but generally more efficient than brute force.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Randomized Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Randomized algorithms make random choices during their execution, providing good average performance or even probabilistic guarantees. These algorithms can sometimes outperform deterministic algorithms, especially in cases where deterministic algorithms are hard to optimize.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Quick Sort (with random pivot), Monte Carlo methods, Las Vegas algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Often O(n log n) on average, but can depend on randomness.</li>
        </ul>
