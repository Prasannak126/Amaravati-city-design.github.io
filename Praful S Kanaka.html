        <h2>1. Types of Problems in Nature (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
        <p>Many computational problems can be categorized based on how they are solved, particularly using iterative, recursive, or backtracking approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iteration</strong> involves repeating a set of instructions until a condition is met. Common in problems where you know the number of iterations ahead of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursion</strong> occurs when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem. It's useful when the problem can naturally be divided into subproblems.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking</strong> is used for problems involving choices, where you explore all possibilities and "backtrack" when a dead-end is reached (e.g., puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens problem).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Space and time efficiency refer to how efficiently an algorithm uses computer resources (memory and time) to solve a problem.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Efficiency</strong> is measured by how fast an algorithm runs as the input size grows. It is often expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n^2)).</li>
            <li><strong>Space Efficiency</strong> refers to the amount of memory the algorithm uses during its execution. Similarly, it is also expressed in Big O notation (e.g., O(1) for constant space, O(n) for linear space).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>Efficiency is crucial for handling large data sets or real-time systems where excessive resource consumption can lead to poor performance or failure to meet operational requirements.</p>
        <h3>Class of Problems and Orders of Growth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constant Time:</strong> O(1) - Algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size (e.g., accessing an array element).</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Time:</strong> O(n) - Time grows linearly with the size of the input (e.g., linear search).</li>
            <li><strong>Quadratic Time:</strong> O(n^2) - Time grows quadratically (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort).</li>
            <li><strong>Logarithmic Time:</strong> O(log n) - Time grows logarithmically (e.g., binary search).</li>
            <li><strong>Exponential Time:</strong> O(2^n) - Time grows exponentially (e.g., brute force approaches to problems like traveling salesman).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>3. Takeaways from Chapter 2: Design Principles</h2>
        <p>Chapter 2 of a typical algorithms textbook focuses on fundamental algorithmic design principles. Key takeaways might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve each recursively, and combine the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to a globally optimal solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Break problems into overlapping subproblems and store solutions to avoid redundant work (memoization).</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Explore all possibilities and backtrack when a solution path fails.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h2>
        <p>Tree data structures are excellent for modeling hierarchical data. They optimize search and insertion operations, among others.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Tree:</strong> Each node has at most two children, left and right. It's the most basic form of tree structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> A binary tree where the left child of a node is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger. It optimizes searching and insertion to O(log n) on average.</li>
            <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST where the height difference between the left and right subtrees is at most 1, ensuring O(log n) operations.</li>
            <li><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> A self-balancing search tree where every internal node has either two or three children, ensuring balanced height.</li>
            <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A type of self-balancing binary search tree with color properties to ensure balanced operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap:</strong> A binary tree where the parent node is either greater than or smaller than the children (depending on max-heap or min-heap). It is used for efficient priority queues.</li>
            <li><strong>Trie:</strong> A tree-like data structure used to store strings in a way that allows for fast lookup, insertion, and prefix-based search.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Array Query Algorithms and Their Implications</h2>
        <p>Array query algorithms help in efficiently retrieving or updating elements in an array. Their implications are significant in applications such as databases and high-performance computing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prefix Sum:</strong> A technique to preprocess an array so that the sum of any subarray can be queried in constant time.</li>
            <li><strong>Segment Tree:</strong> A tree-based data structure for efficiently answering range queries and updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree):</strong> A more space-efficient alternative to segment trees for answering cumulative frequency queries.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Tree vs. Graphs and Their Traversals</h2>
        <p>Both trees and graphs are used to represent hierarchical relationships, but they differ in structure and traversal strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tree:</strong> A hierarchical structure with a single root node. Traversals include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-order:</strong> Visit the root, then left subtree, then right subtree.</li>
                    <li><strong>In-order:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-order:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then right subtree, then the root.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Graph:</strong> A non-hierarchical structure with nodes and edges that can form cycles. Traversals include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> Explore as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> Explore all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Sorting and searching are fundamental operations in computer science. Common algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> Divide the array into halves, sort each half, and merge them back together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> Select a pivot, partition the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sort each partition.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear Search:</strong> Check each element sequentially.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Divide the search interval in half repeatedly (requires sorted array).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </
