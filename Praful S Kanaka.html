        <h2>1. Types of Problems in Nature (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
        <p>Many computational problems can be categorized based on how they are solved, particularly using iterative, recursive, or backtracking approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Involves repeating a set of instructions until a condition is met. Common in problems where you know the number of iterations ahead of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> Occurs when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem. It's useful when the problem can naturally be divided into subproblems.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Used for problems involving choices, where you explore all possibilities and "backtrack" when a dead-end is reached (e.g., puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens problem).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Space and time efficiency refer to how efficiently an algorithm uses computer resources (memory and time) to solve a problem.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Measured by how fast an algorithm runs as the input size grows. It is often expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(nÂ²)).</li>
            <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the amount of memory the algorithm uses during its execution. Similarly, it is also expressed in Big O notation (e.g., O(1) for constant space, O(n) for linear space).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>Efficiency is crucial for handling large data sets or real-time systems where excessive resource consumption can lead to poor performance or failure to meet operational requirements.</p>

        <h2>3. Takeaways from Chapter 2: Design Principles</h2>
        <p>Key takeaways might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve each recursively, and combine the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to a globally optimal solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Break problems into overlapping subproblems and store solutions to avoid redundant work.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h2>
        <p>Tree data structures are excellent for modeling hierarchical data and optimizing search and insertion operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Tree:</strong> Each node has at most two children, left and right.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> A binary tree where the left child is smaller and the right child is larger than the parent node.</li>
            <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST with height difference at most 1, ensuring O(log n) operations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Array Query Algorithms and Their Implications</h2>
        <p>These algorithms help in efficiently retrieving or updating elements in an array:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prefix Sum:</strong> Preprocesses an array so the sum of any subarray can be queried in constant time.</li>
            <li><strong>Segment Tree:</strong> A tree-based data structure for efficiently answering range queries and updates.</li>
        </ul>
