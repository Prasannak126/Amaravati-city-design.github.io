    <h1>Business Case Study: Use of Arrays in Transportation for City Planning</h1>
    
    <p>In modern city planning, managing transportation routes, schedules, and resources efficiently is crucial. One common way to handle such data is through arrays, which are used in programming and systems design to store and manipulate information systematically. This case study explores how arrays can optimize transportation systems for city planning.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Arrays in Transportation Systems</h2>
    <p>Arrays are data structures that allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. For transportation systems, arrays can be used to manage various aspects, such as bus routes, passenger schedules, and vehicle availability. By using arrays, city planners can optimize the allocation of resources, improve scheduling accuracy, and provide real-time updates.</p>

    <h2>Case Study Example: Transportation Scheduling</h2>
    <p>Let's take the example of a bus system in a city. The city has 3 bus routes with different schedules. We will use arrays to represent the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bus routes (with route numbers)</li>
        <li>Bus schedules (arrival times at different stops)</li>
        <li>Passenger counts (number of passengers on each bus)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Representation Using Arrays</h3>
    <p>The following table shows how the transportation data is structured using arrays:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Bus Route</th>
                <th>Bus Schedule</th>
                <th>Passenger Count</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr class="highlight">
                <td>Route 101</td>
                <td>["08:00 AM", "09:00 AM", "10:00 AM"]</td>
                <td>[15, 20, 25]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Route 102</td>
                <td>["08:30 AM", "09:30 AM", "10:30 AM"]</td>
                <td>[10, 18, 22]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="highlight">
                <td>Route 103</td>
                <td>["09:00 AM", "10:00 AM", "11:00 AM"]</td>
                <td>[30, 25, 28]</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Array Operations for City Planning</h3>
    <p>City planners can use various operations on these arrays to improve the transportation system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Finding the bus route with the maximum passenger count to allocate more buses during peak hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Dynamically adjusting bus schedules based on real-time passenger data using array manipulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Using arrays to track vehicle availability and assigning buses efficiently to each route.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By leveraging arrays in transportation systems, city planners can ensure smoother operations, better resource allocation, and improved service for residents. Arrays allow for quick access to data, easy modifications, and real-time updates, making them an essential tool in modern city planning and transportation management.</p>
